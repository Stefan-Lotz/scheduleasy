# Scheduleasy

Scheduleasy allows users to quickly and intuitively create a custom bell schedule. 

Designed for educators and businesses, Scheduleasy empowers anyone to see how much time remains in a bell schedule period at a glance. After uploading their created schedules for others to view, schedule owners can send messages to their schedule's page, allowing for universal announcements and updates. Don't want to create an account? Users can view any schedule's page at any time -- even without an account.

Scheduleasy was created by Stefan Lotz for the 2024 Congressional App Challenge.
